# Python Web Server from Scratch

This project implements a basic web server using only Python's standard libraries. Features will be added step-by-step: routing, static file serving, middleware, and tests.

## How to Run

1. Run the server:
   ```powershell
   python run.py
   ```
2. Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
